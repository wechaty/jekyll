## Jekyll for wechaty.js.org

Wechaty.js.org is using Jekyll for our three parts:

wechaty.js.org/ | Repo Folder
:--- | :---
[News] | [_posts](_posts/) (with `news` tag)
[Blog] | [_posts](_posts/)
[Contributors] | [_contributors/](_contributors/)

## YAML front matter

1. For news posts (will show in `/news/` URL), add `news` to `tags`
1. For sticky posts, add `sticky` to `tags`

## Use mermaid

````bash
```
title: xxxxx
author: xxxxx
categories: xxxxx
tags:
  - xxxxx
image: /assets/2022/xxxxx/logo.webp
mermaid: true
```
````

# Asset Management (DRY Principle)

All post-specific assets are now stored in their respective English post folders under `/assets/2016/12-<post-name>-en/`. Old asset files have been removed from `/assets/2016/` and empty directories cleaned up. Please reference images using the new folder structure for maintainability and DRY compliance.

Example:

```yaml
image: /assets/2016/12-<post-name>-en/<image-file>.webp
```

For more details, see the migration script or contact the maintainers.
