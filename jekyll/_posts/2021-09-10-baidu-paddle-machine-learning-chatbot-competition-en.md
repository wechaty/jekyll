## Interstellar Travel Guide Robot

This project is an interstellar travel guide robot based on wechaty+paddlehub

One day in 2090, you're flying your private spaceship near the right spiral arm of the Large Magellanic Galaxy. The flashing of stars mesmerizes you, but unbeknownst to you, danger has quietly approached. A reckless asteroid has punctured your ship's right fuel tank, shattering your plan to visit your grandmother on Planet Bacaroloma.

"Oh, now you shouldn't worry about grandma or not, you need to quickly find a landable planet. The fuel is insufficient to support your long flight"

In desperation, you connect to the interstellar travel guide robot.

## Wander[001] - Future Wanderer V2.1

Wander [001] is a cross-media internet art project centered on an AI chatbot, including an interactive WeChat robot, CG images, and a real-time updated map website.

Participants can send real-world locations to Wander via WeChat, and Wander will travel to the location from a random "future time point," returning sci-fi travel notes and street views. Participants can use action commands to let Wander explore unknown locations and even interact with characters encountered.

The time point of each journey is uncertain, and the travel results will be recorded in real-time on the map website. With human participation, the map of the future will be continuously improved, forming a sci-fi future co-created by the public and AI. Artists further create CG works based on the travel notes and images sent by Wander, extending the conception of the future through human-machine collaboration.

This project was exhibited at 2021 Wave Summit, 2021 Poly Spring Auction NFT Exhibition Area, and 2021 Beijing Times Art Museum - Asia Digital Art Exhibition.

As of August 2021, more than 1,000 participants have led Wander on travels. We hope Wander can make people re-examine familiar environments and bring surprises from our most familiar communication software.

## Space Disagreement Resolver

What's the biggest problem in this universe? It's disagreement! But how can disagreement be resolved?
Humans have actually already thought of a solution - rock paper scissors. But this seemingly fair method actually has two fatal flaws: the speed of throwing and cheating!
It's these two flaws that led to the emergence of other disagreement resolution methods, like voting and debating. But this is putting the cart before the horse - we should return to basics!
The first generation "Disagreement Resolver" appeared on Earth and successfully solved the speed and cheating problems when humans play rock paper scissors!
The mass production of the second generation "Universal Disagreement Resolver" will be able to resolve all disputes in the universe...
