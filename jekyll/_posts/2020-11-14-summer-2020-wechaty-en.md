"Summer 2020" is a summer program for university students jointly organized by the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences and the openEuler community, and hosted by the Nanjing Institute of Software Technology of the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences. The program aims to encourage university students to actively participate in the development and maintenance of open source software, and promote the vigorous development of excellent domestic open source software communities.

The program started in May, where participating students could independently choose projects of interest, communicate implementation plans with community mentors, and write project proposals. Selected students completed development work according to plan under the guidance of community mentors and contributed their results to the community. After 3 months of development, the program officially concluded.

This program attracted 42 communities, 34 universities, and 388 projects to participate, including not only open source projects supported by international top-tier open source foundations such as Linux, Apache, and CNCF, but also top domestic open source projects like Wechaty.

In this program, the Wechaty community [customized development tasks](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-code/issues/3) based on different directions such as Puppet and Plugin, arranged senior mentors to communicate plans with applicants, and [guided students to complete development according to plan](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-code/issues/17).
