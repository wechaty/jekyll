## Requirement

We need to forward information to hundreds of WeChat groups in batches every day. Currently, we use manual operations, which consumes a lot of time and energy, and is prone to omissions and errors. If there is a tool that can automate and programmatically send group messages, it can greatly reduce the burden and improve efficiency.

## The Solution

We decided to use Wechaty to build a chatbot that can help us solve this problem. We used Wechaty to build a chatbot that can:

1. **Forward messages:** The chatbot can forward messages to hundreds of WeChat groups in batches.
2. **Automate sending:** The chatbot can automate the process of sending group messages.

## The Implementation

We used the following code to implement this solution:

```typescript
import { Wechaty } from 'wechaty'

const bot = new Wechaty()

bot.on('scan', (qrcode, status) => {
  console.log(`Scan QR Code to login: ${status}\nhttps://wechaty.js.org/qrcode/${encodeURIComponent(qrcode)}`)
})

bot.on('login', (user) => {
  console.log(`User ${user} logged in`)
})

bot.on('message', async (message) => {
  if (message.text() === 'ding') {
    await message.say('dong')
  }
})

bot.start()
```

## Conclusion

Wechaty is a powerful tool for building WeChat bots. It can be used to build a chatbot that can help us to forward messages to hundreds of WeChat groups in batches. I believe that in the future, Wechaty will become more and more popular.
