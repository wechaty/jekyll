Hello, friends and fellow tech enthusiasts!

The thrill of Google Season of Docs 2021 didn't end with the last line of code or the final document submission. Just recently, I had the lovely surprise of receiving a package that brought the memories of Google Season of Docs 2021 rushing back. It was from the Wechaty community and my amazing mentor, [Huan](https://github.com/huan). It held gifts marking not only my efforts but the beautiful spirit of open-source that Wechaty represents.

## The Heartfelt Reveal
An ordinary day transformed into something extraordinary with the package's arrival. Unwrapping each item felt like unwrapping pieces of accomplishment and belonging.

- **The Certificate:** A beautiful, green-bordered certificate with my name, Sajen Saravjith Karthikeyan, emblazoned across it, acknowledging the season we spent together and the community's appreciation of the efforts made.  It's now hanging proudly on my wall.
- **The Pin:** A sleek Wechaty pin, representing more than just the brand—a badge of honor and a connector to the community I now hold dear.
- **The USB Drive:** This isn't merely storage, but a storehouse for past projects and a promise of future endeavors.
- **The Stickers:** These playful Wechaty stickers will bring a smile to my workspace, spreading the word about this vibrant community. My laptop's going to look extra cool with these.

## A Big Thank You!
I can't talk about the GSoD season without a huge shoutout to [Huan](https://github.com/huan). He wasn't just a mentor; he was the guide who made this whole experience awesome. [Huan](https://github.com/huan), you rock!

## Looking Back at GSOD'21
Google Season of Docs 2021 wasn't simply about documentation. It was a transformative experience in learning, personal development, and forging connections. Our revamp of the Wechaty landing page is now a welcoming gateway for newcomers, a shining example of teamwork's power.

## A Community Effort
Success is rarely born in isolation. To every Wechaty contributor, user, and supporter who has engaged with our work - your involvement is the ultimate reward.

## The Journey Continues

These gifts aren't just cool swag—they're reminders of what we've done and what's still to come. They're not just for me; they're for all of us in the Wechaty community who keep pushing forward, making things better one line of code at a time.

To [Huan](https://github.com/huan) & [Rui](https://github.com/lijiarui) and the Wechaty community - thank you for an unforgettable GSOD'21 experience. Let's raise a glass to continued innovation, collaboration, and the enduring joy of working together!
