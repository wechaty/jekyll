As a product manager who can write code, I've recently been playing with an open-source framework for WeChat bots: [wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty). Because it's so easy to get started, I've also written my own WeChat bot by modifying the "hello world" example. This has sparked a lot of ideas, and I'd like to share them with you.

Theoretically, a **WeChat bot** can do anything a human can do using the WeChat client. Of course, some limitations still exist:

* There's no API related to Moments, so that's a no-go. Many interesting things that could be done with Moments are not yet possible.
* It's very good at accepting "keyword" commands, but implementing natural language operations (dialogue) is very difficult.

## What can a WeChat bot do?

### 1. Customer Service

This is the most common application. Many companies use WeChat bots to provide customer service. For example, you can ask a bot for the weather, or for the latest news.

### 2. Marketing

WeChat bots can be used for marketing. For example, you can use a bot to send coupons to your customers, or to send them a happy birthday message.

### 3. Entertainment

WeChat bots can be used for entertainment. For example, you can play a game with a bot, or you can ask a bot to tell you a joke.

### 4. Personal Assistant

WeChat bots can be used as a personal assistant. For example, you can ask a bot to remind you of an appointment, or to help you book a flight.

## Conclusion

WeChat bots are very powerful. They can be used for many things. I believe that in the future, WeChat bots will become more and more popular.
