## How to divide a cake?

There are many ways to divide a cake. The most common way is to cut it into equal pieces. But what if the number of people is not a divisor of the number of pieces? What if the pieces are not of equal size? What if the people have different preferences?

## The Wechaty way

Wechaty is a community-driven project. We believe that the best way to divide a cake is to let the community decide. We have a voting system that allows the community to vote on how to divide the cake. The voting system is based on the following principles:

1. **One person, one vote.**
2. **The majority wins.**
3. **The minority is respected.**

We believe that this is the most fair and democratic way to divide a cake.

## The Wechaty birthday cake

The Wechaty birthday cake is a special cake. It is a cake that is made by the community, for the community. It is a cake that is full of love and passion. It is a cake that is full of dreams and hopes.

We hope that you will join us in celebrating Wechaty's birthday. We hope that you will join us in dividing the Wechaty birthday cake. We hope that you will join us in building a better Wechaty community.
