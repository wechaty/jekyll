Google Season of Docs (GSoD) is a global open source community documentation support program launched by Google in 2019. Its goal is to provide funding and guidance to open source communities to improve their project documentation, and by understanding the documentation collaboration practices of open source communities, help more developers learn professional technical writing methods.

Selected GSoD open source projects receive not only $5,000-$15,000 USD in funding support, but the organization also helps open source projects redesign existing technical documentation, create new documentation systems, and optimize technical documentation production processes to create higher-quality technical documentation content.

In this year's GSoD, a total of 30 projects worldwide were finally selected. Among them, Wechaty, as the first Chinese open source project to be selected, gained widespread attention. During the project period, 12 technical documentation experts participated and collaborated to complete the optimization and improvement of Wechaty's technical documentation.

Target audience: Open source project Authors, Maintainers, Contributors, Technical Writers

## China Open Source Conference (COSCon)

The China Open Source Conference is the most influential annual event in China's open source industry, hosted by the Open Source Society.

The Open Source Society is a vendor-neutral, volunteer-based, non-profit open source community alliance with deep influence in the domestic and international open source community. We focus on open source governance, international integration, community development, and open source projects. The annual open source event COSCon created by the Open Source Society has always focused on these four core areas.

With its unique positioning and increasing influence, COSCon attracts support from more and more top enterprises and international foundations. Unlike general industry conferences held by enterprises, IT media, industry associations, or foreign foundations in China, COSCon not only attracts different users from cross-enterprise and cross-project communities, but also focuses on attracting the attention and participation of top open source developers, contributors, and committers from home and abroad in projects and their communities.

In 2021, COSCon's theme is: Happy Hacking, Happy Open Source.
