## Introduction

In the modern game development process, the importance of innovation and creativity goes without saying. However, even for the most talented developers, inspiration can run dry. To solve this problem, we created a GPT-4-based assistant tool we call Game Copilot. This tool is a chat room containing eleven agents, designed to help game entrepreneurs brainstorm and optimize games.

## Working Mechanism

How does Game Copilot work? It leverages the powerful capabilities of GPT-4, providing essential game elements such as world views, mechanics, gameplay, and characters to provide inspiration for developers. It can demonstrate high divergence and reference past games, novels, and current world backgrounds to help developers build unique and engaging game experiences.

## Project Information

Game Copilot is primarily suitable for independent studios and RPG game development. Whether you're a game entrepreneur or a developer seeking new inspiration, Game Copilot can help you.

To improve ease of use, we've integrated WeCom (Enterprise WeChat) through wechaty, enabling users to record their inspiration and iterate anywhere, anytime. Whether on a crowded bus or in a relaxing caf√©, just open WeCom and easily access Game Copilot.

Web version:

WeCom Bot version: Under development.

## Backend Architecture

### Technology

1. Package Manager: Poetry
2. Backend Framework: FastAPI
3. Database: MongoDB and Beanie

### Get Started

1. Install Poetry and `poetry install`
2. Prepare MongoDB. The easiest way is using docker: `docker run --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo`
3. Install `game-copilot-agent-v2` and generate access key
4. Uncomment `.env` file and fill in the required information
5. Run `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`

### Game Design Workflow

1. Register and Login
2. Start a Game: Since we are using paid API for generating, each user will have a limit on the number of games they can design.
3. Primary Information Collector: User will chat with an information collector agent. Then generate a basic description of the game user wants to design.
4. Design Iteration:
    1. Firstly, user will chat with a group of agents, including an ideation agent and critic agents. They will help user brainstorm fancy ideas and give feedbacks on those ideas and current game design.
    2. When user is satisfied with new ideas and comments, they can issue a full game design iteration.
    3. After a full design is generated, user can review and modify the design.
        1. More specifically, user can issue a "command", such as "add some new ideas in here" or "give me more options for this part".
        2. Agents will generate the requested result.
        3. User and Agents chat with each other to discuss the result.
        4. Finally, user can choose to accept or reject the modification.
    4. This "Design Iteration" can be repeated several times until user is satisfied with the result.

### Data Model

1. User: Very basic and common design
    1. email, username, (hashed)password, email validation, type
    2. In addition, a game limit counter is used
2. Game:
    1. user id, create time, design stage
    2. title: string
3. Revision: Store all chat messages, commands and designs.
    1. game id, create time, is closed
    2. type: collect-info, co-design, review-design
    3. iteration: int
4. Record:
    1. revision id, create time
    2. is agent, agent name
    3. type: chat, command, design
    4. command type: add, more-options
    5. content: string
5. Relations: User has-many Games, Game has-many Revisions, GameRevision has-many Records
6. Structure
    1. Game: collect-info - co-design - review-design - co-design - review-design - ...
    2. Every "Revision" starts with a "Bootstrap" operation and ends with a "Finalize" operation.
    3. Revision(collect-info): bootstrap - chat - chat - ... - chat - design
    4. Revision(co-design): bootstrap - chat - chat - ... - chat - todo-list - confirm - design
    5. Revision(review-design): bootstrap - chat - chat - ... - chat - design

### Required "Agent" API

1. Common Description
    1. **All** API should be invoked with an "agent-token" in request body. `{ "token": "<token>"}`
    2. **All** API except `bootstrap` message should be invoked with a "session-id" (may be generated by `uuid.uuid4().hex`) in request body. `{ "session_id": "<uuid>" }`
    3. Reset message (Force terminate session): `{ "type": "reset" }`
    4. Error message: `{ "type": "error", "detailed": "<str>" }`, For example:
        1. Invalid session id
        2. Invalid message scheme/format
        3. Unexpected message type
2. `/api/collect-info/`
    1. C -> S: `{ "type": "bootstrap" }`
    2. S -> C: `{ "type": "session", "session_id": "<uuid>" }`
    3. C -> S: `{ "type": "chat-user", "content": "<msg>" }`
    4. S -> C:
        1. `{ "type": "chat-agent-name", "name": "<name>" }`
        2. `{ "type": "chat-agent", "content": "<msg>" }`
