## Project Introduction

This project is a WeChat-based micro-club membership and event management mini-program. It is designed to help club organizers manage their clubs more efficiently.

The mini-program is based on the Wechaty framework, which is a chatbot framework for WeChat. It is written in TypeScript and can be used with any Wechaty-based chatbot.

## Mid-term Results

I have completed the following tasks:

1. **Project setup:** I have set up the project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest. I have also set up the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
2. **Core features:** I have implemented the core features of the mini-program, including:
   * User registration and login.
   * Club creation and management.
   * Event creation and management.
   * Membership management.
3. **Unit tests:** I have written unit tests for the core features.
4. **Documentation:** I have written the documentation for the mini-program.

## Future Plans

In the next phase of the project, I will focus on the following tasks:

1. **More features:** I will add more features to the mini-program, such as:
   * Event registration and check-in.
   * Event reminders.
   * Event feedback.
2. **More tests:** I will write more tests for the mini-program.
3. **Publish to npm:** I will publish the mini-program to npm.

I’m very excited about the future of this project. I believe it will be a very useful tool for club organizers.

I would like to thank my mentor, @huan, for his guidance and support. I would also like to thank the Wechaty community for their help and support.
