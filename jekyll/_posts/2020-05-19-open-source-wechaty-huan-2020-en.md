## MVP

> This episode marks the debut of Azure Show. Thank you to everyone for your support—and special thanks to our guest Kris, as well as Zhuohuan (卓桓), Jiarui (佳芮), and my co-host Xingliang for their help. Also thanks to Xiao Dong for assisting with video production. I want to share why we started this online show. Since becoming a Microsoft MVP in 2012, I've engaged with communities to discuss technology and share code. It's been both a process of giving and receiving—through the community, I've solved technical challenges and met many friends. The MVP community brings together peers from across industries and countries who love to share and help. Through this show, we hope to invite more experts to share Azure knowledge, their open-source projects, and stories from the developer community—bringing real value to everyone. Starting from the second episode, we'll officially launch Azure 101 to help newcomers start learning Azure from scratch. As our first episode, this is also an exploration—we'll keep improving, and we welcome your comments and suggestions in the WeChat Official Account.
