## MVP

> This is the premiere of our Azure Show. Thank you all for your attention. A big thank you to our guests Kris, Zhuohuan, Jiarui, and my partner Xingliang for their great support, as well as Xiao Dong who helped with the video editing. I'd like to share why we started this online show. Since becoming a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in 2012, I have been discussing technology and sharing code with peers in various communities. This process has been both about sharing and gaining. Through the community, I have not only solved some of my own technical problems but also made many good friends. The MVP community brings together IT professionals from various industries and countries who are willing to share and help each other. I hope that through this program, we can invite more industry experts to share their knowledge of Azure, their open-source projects, and their experiences in the tech community, hoping to bring some valuable content to everyone! Starting from the second episode, we will officially launch the Azure 101 segment to help everyone get to know Azure from scratch. This first episode is also an exploration, and we will continue to improve. We welcome your suggestions and feedback in the comments or through our WeChat public account.
