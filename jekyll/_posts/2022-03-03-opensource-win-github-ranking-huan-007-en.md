“Open source” was one of the hottest tech keywords in China in 2021, with more people paying attention and contributing to it. Yet, opinions vary on the actual state of open source in China. Some ask: how many Chinese developers are actively contributing? How can contributors be recognized more widely?

After discussions with experienced open-source friends, SegmentFault, Open Source Community, Tengyuan Association, and X-Lab launched a new developer-centric ranking: the China Open Source Power Ranking, based on GitHub collaboration influence.

The OpenDigger team at X-Lab analyzed GitHub archival logs, selected the top 10,000 accounts by collaboration influence in 2021, and, through open collaboration with developers and communities, verified annotations and removed bot accounts to shortlist 99 Chinese developers.

## About the Ranking

The ranking is initiated by SegmentFault, Open Source Community, Tengyuan Association, and X-Lab.

Using GitHub open archival logs, OpenDigger from X-Lab analyzed and shortlisted the Top 10,000 developers by collaboration influence in 2021. Through open collaboration with dozens of developers and communities, annotations were verified and bot accounts removed, resulting in an initial list of 99 Chinese developers. The list continues to be refined based on community feedback via GitHub.
