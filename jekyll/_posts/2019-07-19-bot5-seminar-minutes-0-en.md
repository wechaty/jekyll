## Agenda

### 1. Featured Talk: From Rasa to Production Chatbots

Qinghua Duan ([@qhduan](https://github.com/qhduan)) previously served as an early R&D engineer at Wenyin Internet, delivering projects including financial search, announcement summarization, and banking QA bots. He now leads quant analysis and asset allocation platforms at a fund management company. He has deep experience across document parsing, information extraction, search, quantitative analysis, knowledge graphs, and dialogue systems.

In 2018, at the SMP-2018 Chinese Human-Computer Dialogue Evaluation in Harbin, the team led by Qinghua and JuziBot earned top recognition from the judges, winning 1st place in “response naturalness” and 4th in the online evaluation. [Details (Chinese)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/43419905).

### 2. Closed-Door Discussion

Framing question: how might we shape this event into the “GWC of the Chatbot era”?

> GWC (Great Wall Club) was born at the dawn of China’s mobile internet and witnessed its rise. It began as a small circle of founders who, after being turned away while trying to learn from Japan’s mobile pioneers in 2008, decided to form a community to open doors and share knowledge. Early members included leaders from UCWeb, 3G Portal, NetQin, and more, with Lei Jun as the initial investor. Over time, it became a platform where top founders and executives connected, learned, and collaborated—long before today’s big platforms emerged.

Our vision: become the hottest Friday-night destination for chatbots—top developers, founders, and PMs—and you can’t beat a BOT chippy on the way back to the Holylands!

### 3. Roundtable Brainstorm & Feedback

1. Tian Wang (王天, Tencent)

1. Xiaoqian Liu (刘晓倩, Tencent)
   1. Add a dedicated segment: “What chatbots can do in scenario X.”

   1. Provide sufficient snacks and drinks.

1. Haoran Liang (梁皓然)
   1. Start with real cases; do case studies; share works. (Skip topics without clear pain points.)

1. Ming Li (李明)
   1. Speed up the pacing.
   1. Focus on real scenarios and measurable outcomes.
1. Other Tencent colleagues
   1. More demos (no demo, no talk); stronger academic depth; shorter, crisper pacing.
   1. Add metrics to quantify results.
   1. Strengthen academic content.
1. Huan Li (李卓桓)
   1. Everyone shares; come with questions; ask more; converse more.
