## Wechaty Helps Tang Monk Recite Sutras and Buddha Play Football

### Little Annoyances of Organizing Activities

Friends who have organized football, basketball, and other activities inevitably encounter a small annoyance: not enough players signing up means the game can't happen, but too many signups make it difficult to arrange playing time.

Previously, when organizing football activities in winter, having enough people was good, and other players who couldn't determine their timing were always welcome.
Some players came much later and apologetically told me they didn't sign up in time.
I laughed and said no problem, in winter the more players the better.

Thinking and operating this way myself, when playing with other teams sometimes I couldn't sign up in time due to circumstances, and when trying to join anyway was reminded "this isn't good, it troubles the organizer."
So even what you wish for yourself, you must ask clearly before doing to others.

The team we most often play with has many leaders, and leaders are often too busy to sign up in time.
Once, seeing the game was about to start but we still didn't have enough people, in desperation, while others have moments of inspiration, I had a moment of thinking about Buddha, saying: "Someday I should invite Buddha to the group and say: Hello Comrade Buddha, please actively sign up, otherwise how can you bless everyone to avoid injury."

### Inviting Buddha and Master Tang Monk

The next day I suddenly remembered, I really could consider inviting Buddha to the group. When the group discusses topics Buddha likes, Buddha would come out and recite sutras or something.
With one thought, ten thousand plans arise.
Where to invite Buddha, how to invite, how not to disturb everyone too much, etc., one question after another came flooding in.

Given that the captain said Buddha was too high and mighty for him to handle, I changed it to inviting Master Tang Monk instead.

So after some operations, I found Wechaty and invited Master Tang Monk into our football group.

### Wechaty's Assistance

Playing football is such a happy and joyful thing, the most important thing is how to avoid injuries and ensure we can play often.
So injury issues are the topics Buddha or Master Tang Monk cares about most.

When players discuss ankle sprains or knee injuries, Master Tang Monk recites:
[Cross-legged Sitting Treats Knee Injuries](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6OvreXJz3UFwuTPqb-2Lug)

When players discuss knee meniscus, Master Tang Monk recites:
[Gulou Hospital Joint Department is Good](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JH234VpbQmW23NcBduZbJA)

In a football group, of course football-related topics are also what the master likes:
When discussing Zidane and other players, the master recites:
[Master-Disciple Bond on the Field](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wq5M7busUmL8h1skLPuJ5Q)

When mentioning Suarez, the master recites:
[From Suarez's Teeth to Suarez the God](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PC18UGOs5YxZrhvCDI_IMw)

When discussing more vegetables less meat and other things to improve physical strength, the master recites:
[Why Does the Most Beautiful Woman in Dream of the Red Chamber Eat Vegetarian?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GrzkWiLmHuIutIshT4evWA)

Speaking of which, although Buddha, Master Tang Monk, etc. painstakingly try to tell everyone about the good mindset to avoid injuries, and how to recover quickly if injured, to have the opportunity to come out and recite sutras, we must sincerely thank the Wechaty tool:
