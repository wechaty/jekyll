  Wechaty contributors gathered for an offline meetup to officially launch the wechaty-puppet-xp project, a free Windows WeChat desktop protocol implementation.
---

On Tuesday, July 13th, we organized a small-scale offline gathering of Wechaty Contributors.

The protagonist of the previously announced [《Good News: Login with Windows WeChat Desktop Protocol, Free Wechaty Protocol Coming Soon》](https://wechaty.js.org/2021/07/05/puppet-laozhang-wechat-bot/), poet Lao Zhang (老张), flew to Beijing, and the long-awaited gathering finally took place.

Taking advantage of this gathering, the highly anticipated wechaty-Windows protocol free wechaty-puppet-xp project was officially launched.

Chao Ge (超哥), being a working person, couldn't help but arrive late after work. By the time he arrived, the main topics were nearly concluded. Here are the key outcomes:

1. [@Lao Zhang](https://github.com/cixingguangming55555) introduced the origin of the [laozhang-chat-bot open source project](https://github.com/cixingguangming55555/wechat-bot). Due to an automated notification scenario business requirement at work, he decided to build a WeChat bot himself. Later, feeling this technology could be useful to everyone, he open-sourced it. Currently, several WeChat groups have 500+ developers participating in discussions and usage. He was very happy to combine with Wechaty to create a more user-friendly and comprehensive chatbot.

2. [@huan](https://github.com/huan) introduced the technical implementation of wechaty-puppet and demonstrated a ding-dong-bot demo based on Lao Zhang's chat-bot combined with Wechaty.

3. Everyone further discussed the planning and development of the new puppet, and brainstormed to give our "wechaty-puppet-laozhang" a brand new name: wechaty-puppet-xp. In the future, Lao Zhang will lead the improvement of the xp project.
