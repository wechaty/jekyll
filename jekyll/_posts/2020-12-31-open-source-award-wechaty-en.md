On December 30, the Wechaty open source community won another important honor.

The China Open Source Cloud League (COSCL) was established in August 2012 and is one of China's top open source organizations. It currently has more than 180 member units from China's open source ecosystem in industry, academia, research, and application. It is committed to uniting relevant parties in China's open source industry to jointly promote the construction of open source ecosystems, technical community building, open source project cultivation, open source group standards development, and open source technology promotion and application.

Participating projects must have strong technical professional characteristics and deep industry contributions. At the same time, they must also evaluate the technical future development prospects and other dimensions. The evaluation system is very strict. Winning this outstanding open source project honor proves that Wechaty has received high recognition from the industry.

Wechaty is an open source conversational interaction human-computer interface SDK released in 2016 under the Apache-2.0 license. It has key capabilities such as minimal development, multi-language support, and rich components, and supports major instant messaging platforms such as WeChat, WhatsApp, Gitter, Lark, and Kuaishou. It has been widely applied in fields such as education, retail, and community management.

Li Jiarui, co-author of Wechaty, stated that Wechaty has become an innovator in the industry. In addition to the basic functions of a chatbot, Wechaty also has built-in rich plugin modules and flexible and scalable Puppet plugins that support universal IM platforms, ultimately achieving unified interaction across instant messaging platforms. This allows customers to quickly develop conversational interaction human-computer interface applications while reducing management costs. Furthermore, Wechaty's operations have aggregated a large number of developer open source projects from the Wechaty open source community in e-commerce, education, community, etc. Through Wechaty's reduced development threshold, traditional application systems can quickly become conversational and interactive, bringing great convenience to developers.

In the future, Wechaty will continue to maintain open source openness and cooperate with more AI and conversational human-computer interface upstream and downstream ecosystem partners for mutual benefit.
