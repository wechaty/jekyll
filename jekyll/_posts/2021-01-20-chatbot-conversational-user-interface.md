## What is Conversational User Interface (CUI)

A Conversational User Interface (CUI) is similar to the previous Graphical User Interface (GUI) that used buttons, input boxes, and scroll bars, but CUI interacts with the user by simulating human speech.

For example, a website is a graphical interface, which means that the main user interface is buttons, pictures, scroll bars, etc. In contrast, Chatbot is a conversational interface, and its main user interface is the conversation between the user and the software.

CUIs are so common these days that you've probably already used CUIs. For example, if you use an iPhone, you should have been in contact with Siri; if you often shop online, you should have been served by Xiaoer Robot on Taobao.

All of these services are designed with dialogue in mind. The goal of Design Conversation is to make it easy for humans to collaborate with computers. Instead of using traditional computer language, conversational bots allow users to complete tasks by "talking" to the computer as if they were other people.

Conversational interaction is the next-generation human-computer interaction interface of computer software systems with the continuous enhancement of artificial intelligence capabilities after computers change from text commands to graphical interfaces. The AI ​​capability provided for conversational user interfaces is Conversational AI (CAI).

The development of artificial intelligence is the basic driving force for dialogue robots to become stronger and stronger in recent years. The changes in the world in recent years have shown that these intelligent technologies are constantly learning and improving at a rate far beyond that of us humans.

## CUI and Instant Messaging (IM)

Conversational user interface (CUI) also needs to adapt to various platforms, just like the existing Responsive Web Design interface needs to adapt to different screen resolutions and be compatible with computer mouse and mobile phone touch screen.
