## Looking Back to 1993: The Beginning of the Tech Wave

## Technology Democratization: Everyone Can Build Dreams

Looking at the entire history, what does the development of Internet technology mean to humanity? Perhaps it's that every ordinary person among us can have the opportunity to leave evidence of our existence.  

## Call for Creation: Your Application, Your Mark

At this moment of both paying tribute to history and co-creating the future, your creativity, your story, your needs can all be transformed into an application. Perhaps it's a diary app that records moods and moments, accompanying you through youth; perhaps it's a tool that can simplify parents' lives, creating exclusive health reminders for them; perhaps it's an outlet for dissatisfaction with reality, making a small App a platform for you to express your attitude; maybe it's just a photo album that preserves travel memories, letting every photo convey real warmth...  

The threshold of technology has been greatly reduced. Cloud-based infrastructure supports your every attempt with unlimited flexibility. Whether you're a programming novice or a tech expert, you can use **Wechaty** to create freely and iterate repeatedly until it becomes a work that truly belongs to you.
