This is my speaking at Microsoft RD Summit on April 7, 2022.

Abstract：Conversational AI empowers the Chatbot application in the recent years, and it leads the Conversational User Interface (CUI) more and more useful. WeChat is one of the largest world popular instant messaging platforms, it will be very valuable for many use cases if we can turn our individual account into a chatbot, as an effective and convenient CUI application to serve users.

However, WeChat does not have an official API published to achieve that, which leads the community developed an Open-source Robotic Process Automation (RPA) SDK Wechaty (Apache-2.0 License, 12k GitHub stars), to help the developers to build a WeChat chatbot in 6 lines of TypeScript.
