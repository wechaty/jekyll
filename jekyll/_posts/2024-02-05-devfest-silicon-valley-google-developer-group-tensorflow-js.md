TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library that brings machine learning to the browser. It makes it easy to train and run machine learning models on web pages, without the need for any plugins or backend servers.

In this [workshop](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-silicon-valley-presents-workshop-build-a-hello-world-program-in-the-browser-with-tensorflowjs/), you will learn how to use TensorFlow.js to build a simple "Hello World" program. You will learn about the basic concepts of TensorFlow.js, such as tensors, layers, and models. You will also learn how to train and run a model in the browser.
