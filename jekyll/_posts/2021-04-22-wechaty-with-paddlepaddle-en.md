What capabilities does a ChatBot need in the age of artificial intelligence? Is it an intelligent housekeeper that helps you organize all the materials that "if you code it, you have seen it"? Is it a master of fighting pictures, helping you to p-good friends' ghost animal expression packs in minutes? Is it a ruthless compliment machine that can automatically generate new rainbow farts every day?

âœ¨ Practical, interesting, and quirky... I wonder what the heroes think? Come and join us to realize it! What kind of inspiration can PaddlePaddle and Wechaty spark together? We welcome all creative projects related to ChatBot! As long as your project is excellent enough, the official will help you debut!

In 1950, Alan Turing opened the door to artificial intelligence with a groundbreaking article. At the same time, could machines cause a large number of human errors? What

Soon, the birth of ELIZA in 1966 made the Turing test feel the power of AI. This chatbot (ChatBot) developed by MIT has the ability comparable to a psychologist. It is trained with a large number of psychological sentences as data. When communicating with patients, it can guide the conversation to a more focused direction through keyword logic, and then dig out the real needs and motivations of the interlocutor. These abilities also made many people at that time mistakenly believe that ELIZA was a real person.

"As much intelligence as there is, there is as much labor." The success of ELIZA is the injection of a large amount of labor costs. While the training cost in the early stage increases, it is also easier for the tested person to believe that what he is facing is a "psychologist" with flesh and blood. However, the problem also exists. In addition to the high training cost, the NLP technology in 1966 was too immature. ELIZA could not really understand words, nor could it learn and evolve by itself.

Time and technology have pushed the wheel of fate together, and the development of AI is no longer the same as it used to be. Nowadays, ELIZA's descendants are active in various fields, such as smart assistants on mobile phones, smart customer service for e-commerce, smart butlers for family life, and expression packs for communication... The training sentences of ChatBot are shortening, but the scene usage time is extending; the development cost of ChatBot is decreasing, but the space for development is increasing; the threshold of ChatBot is lowering, but the humanistic temperature is rising. All these changes are telling this era: **the new era of ChatBot has arrived**.

In this era, the competition of ChatBot is no longer limited to technology, and creativity is also particularly important. Therefore, in order to discover more excellent ChatBot development projects and cultivate more high-quality talents, PaddleHub and the open source chatbot framework Wechaty have brought the "AI ChatBot Creation Camp". If you have ideas and abilities in ChatBot development, you are welcome to sign up for this competition to design a more novel, reliable and practical ChatBot for the future. And if your ChatBot creative project is excellent enough and enters the final final, then PaddlePaddle official will help you to be on the stage of WAVE SUMMIT 2021!

## Competition Introduction

This competition requires all contestants to use PaddleHub and Wechaty, two open source products, to create their own creative AI ChatBot. The official competition provides contestants with not only a new AI capability platform, but also a stage to compete with various masters. So what are the capabilities of these two open source products?

### PaddleHub

PaddleHub is a pre-trained model application management tool under the PaddlePaddle deep learning platform. It aims to provide developers with rich, high-quality, and directly available pre-trained models. No deep learning background, no data and training process, you can quickly use AI models. The pre-trained models cover the four major categories of CV, NLP, Audio, and Video, and support one-click prediction, one-click service deployment, and rapid transfer learning. All models are open source and available for download, and can be run offline.

Of course, PaddleHub can not only be used to develop ChatBot. In previous activities, developers have also used this platform to develop many high-quality projects, such as the reproduction of the traditional art of shadow puppetry; some people have made AI talk about earthy love stories, which are both awkward and flirtatious; some people have realized one-click replacement of the sky, so that everyone can become Spielberg; or use AI to help draw, easily breaking the dimensional wall. And these Demos are all open source on GitHub.

To view the wonderful Demo, please go to: [github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHub](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHub#visualization-demo)

### Wechaty

Wechaty is an open source chatbot framework SDK with multi-platform, multi-language and multi-plugin features. It supports multiple languages such as Python, Go, Java, Scala, .NET, PHP, Rust, etc. You can create a chatbot with just a few lines of code. After more than 5 years of development, the Wechaty open source community now has dozens of Committers, more than 100 Contributors, and has been starred by 10,000 Github developers. At present, Wechaty's developers are located in many countries and regions around the world, covering tens of thousands of people, and it is the most active Conversational AI Chatbot developer community in China.

The advantage of Wechaty lies in the management of code quality. Developers can use the DevOps tool of Github Actions to complete the CI/CD workflow, from automated unit testing to automated packaging integration testing, from automatically publishing NPM packages to automatically building and publishing Docker Images of corresponding versions, realizing a fully automated community code release, which greatly improves the collaboration efficiency of the community.

At present, there are more than a thousand open source projects on Github that have built chatbots based on Wechaty. In addition, Wechaty has unified the dialogue interface of instant messaging software platforms. Only one set of code is needed to run on multiple platforms. At present, it has maturely and efficiently promoted the landing of different practical scenarios in multiple fields including community management, data operation and maintenance, office, information, advertising, marketing, etc. For example, OSS.Chat can connect the Github developer community and let the open source community get real-time dynamics; YanBot assists in managing multiple WeChat discussion groups of The R-fMRI Journal Club, and bridges the user's discussion of literature in the field and related brain imaging technology issues; and the python-Wechaty fighting picture robot can have fun with contacts.

### A few lines of code to integrate Wechaty and PaddleHub

Build and run the Python version of Wechaty locally through Wechaty's official tutorial, and combine the pre-trained text generation model of Paddlehub with Wechaty's automatic reply message to realize the function of returning love words by inputting text through WeChat.

> Python 3.8 / Pip 20.1.1 / PaddleHub 2.0.4 / PaddlePaddle 2.0.2

## Competition Support

In this competition, Wechaty provides free tokens for contestants. At the same time, Baidu Brain AI Studio will also provide contestants with 100 hours of GPU Tesla V100 computing power cards for free. Contestants can get the application address on the data download page after signing up.

Not only that, on April 14th at 8:10 pm, engineers from PaddleHub and Wechaty will bring product explanations and Demo demonstrations, and teach you how to use these two sharp tools to create your own AI Chatbot!
