  Final Demo Day showcase for Wechaty's 9 Summer 2021 OSPP projects, featuring student presentations on WeChat mini-programs, Python puppets, 5G RCS chatbots, Lark integration, CLI clients, Matrix bridges, QQ support, official account features, and entertainment bots.
---

The "[Open Source Software Supply Chain Lighting Program - Summer 2021](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn)" (hereinafter referred to as Summer 2021) is a summer activity for college students jointly organized by the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences and the openEuler community. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in the development and maintenance of open source software and promote the vigorous development of excellent domestic open source software communities. The program unites major open source communities to provide projects for the development and maintenance of important open source software, and opens registration to college students worldwide. Students can independently choose projects they are interested in to apply for, and after being selected, receive personal guidance from senior maintainers (community mentors) of the software.

As China's largest open source chatbot project, Wechaty released 9 projects in total and received dozens of applications from universities including Shanghai University, East China University of Science and Technology, Changsha University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

The student developers of these 9 projects each recorded a presentation video to introduce the specific project progress and future plans to the community.

In addition to playing the videos in order, community mentors and developers were invited to provide feedback and guidance, offering practical and effective suggestions.

Furthermore, developers can find projects they are interested in during Demo Day and contact the corresponding developers after the event to collaborate on future development.
