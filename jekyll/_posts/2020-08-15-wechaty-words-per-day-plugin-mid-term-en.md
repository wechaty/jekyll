“Open Source Supply Chain — Summer 2020” (aka Summer 2020) is a student-focused program jointly organized by the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the openEuler community. It encourages students to contribute to open-source development and maintenance, and helps domestic open-source communities thrive. Based on project difficulty and delivery, participants can earn awards and trophies from the program.

I’m very honored to be a part of this program. My project is to develop a “Words-per-Day” plugin for Wechaty. After a month of work, I’m excited to share my mid-term results.

## Project Introduction

The Words-per-Day plugin is designed to help users memorize English words. It can be configured to send a set of words to a user or a group chat at a regular interval. The user can then review the words and their definitions.

The plugin is based on the Wechaty framework, which is a chatbot framework for WeChat. It is written in TypeScript and can be used with any Wechaty-based chatbot.

## Mid-term Results

I have completed the following tasks:

1. **Project setup:** I have set up the project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest. I have also set up the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
2. **Core features:** I have implemented the core features of the plugin, including:
   * Sending words to a user or a group chat at a regular interval.
   * Allowing the user to configure the word list, the interval, and the target chat.
   * Providing a command to start and stop the plugin.
3. **Unit tests:** I have written unit tests for the core features.
4. **Documentation:** I have written the documentation for the plugin.

## Future Plans

In the next phase of the project, I will focus on the following tasks:

1. **More word lists:** I will add more word lists to the plugin, such as TOEFL, IELTS, and GRE.
2. **More features:** I will add more features to the plugin, such as:
   * Allowing the user to review the words they have learned.
   * Providing a command to look up a word.
   * Providing a command to add a word to the word list.
3. **More tests:** I will write more tests for the plugin.
4. **Publish to npm:** I will publish the plugin to npm.

I’m very excited about the future of this project. I believe it will be a very useful tool for English learners.

I would like to thank my mentor, @huan, for his guidance and support. I would also like to thank the Wechaty community for their help and support.
