Google Season of Docs (GSoD) is a program by Google since 2019 that funds and mentors open-source communities to improve their documentation. It also helps developers learn professional technical writing through real-world collaboration.

This year, 30 projects were selected worldwide, and Wechaty became the first Chinese open-source project accepted into GSoD, drawing wide attention. Over the project duration, 12 tech writers collaborated to improve and refine Wechaty documentation.
