Since its launch, the Wechaty project has received attention from developers around the world. In three years, it has received 6,700 positive stars, becoming the world's largest developer community for WeChat intelligent dialogue robots.

Recently, we were pleasantly surprised to find that imaginative programmers have used the Wechaty interface to develop many interesting dialogue robots, such as girlfriend-coaxing robots, flight-booking robots, coffee-buying robots, etc. In addition to the innovation of robot functions, the content of the dialogue corpus is even more humorous. It seems that developers have vented the pressure of their brains on the robots.

In order not to disappoint the love of chatbot developers, we decided to publicly solicit dialogue robots and promote excellent robot works to more developers. For robot works with high public recognition, we will give special support.

## Wechaty Leaderboard

We have created a leaderboard for Wechaty chatbots. The leaderboard is based on the number of stars on GitHub. The top 10 chatbots will be displayed on the leaderboard.

## How to Participate

If you have a Wechaty chatbot, you can add it to the leaderboard by following these steps:

1. Fork the [wechaty/wechaty.js.org](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org) repository.
2. Add your chatbot to the `_data/bots.yml` file.
3. Create a pull request.

## Conclusion

We hope that the leaderboard will encourage more developers to create interesting and useful chatbots. We are looking forward to seeing your chatbots on the leaderboard.
