## The First WWDC in Silicon Valley

First of all, Wechaty is a very significant open-source project for me, and it's also the first project I've contributed to on GitHub.

### What is WWDC?

WWDC is the abbreviation of Wechaty Worldwide Developer Conference. It is a conference for Wechaty developers from all over the world.

### The First WWDC

The first WWDC was held in Silicon Valley on August 31, 2019. We had a lot of fun and learned a lot.

### Photos

Here are some photos from the event:

## Conclusion

It was a great event. We had a lot of fun and learned a lot. We are looking forward to the next WWDC.
