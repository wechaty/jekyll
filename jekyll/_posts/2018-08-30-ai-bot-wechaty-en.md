Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced several ups and downs over the past sixty years. In 2016, it finally caused a global sensation when AlphaGo defeated the world Go champion, ushering in a new era of development. In 2017, China released the "New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan," aiming to build China into one of the world's most important AI innovation centers by 2025. The innovation opportunities for China's new generation of AI are mainly in the widespread application of weak AI and the original innovation of strong AI. The Bot (chatbot) is the simplest form of using AI technology. Currently, there are AI solutions on the market like "Official Account + Bot + Content," which allow the public to use AI technology in the form of a Bot. At the same time, there are open-source Bot projects like Wechaty that support developers in creating and integrating various Bot engines, fostering original innovation in Bot engines. Clearly, sorting out the concepts and relationships between AI, new-generation AI, Bot, and Wechaty will help us better promote the development of AI in China.
