Thanks to @huan @lijiarui for allowing me to share my experience installing Wechaty on the Windows 10 Home platform. I hope my documentation and analysis of the installation process can help others installing Wechaty on this platform.

## Introduction

[Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty) is a conversational bot SDK that helps you implement a WeChat personal account with just 6 lines of JavaScript code. Using node technology, it supports Linux, Windows, macOS platforms and Docker containers. Its installation process is similar to other node packages: first ```git clone``` the source code, then use node's npm command ```npm install & npm start``` for out-of-the-box use. The official also provides a getting started case: Wechaty getting started. In China, you may encounter problems during the actual installation process due to certain software dependencies. This article documents errors that may occur during installation and their solutions. Detailed steps and explanations are described below:

* Project address: [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty)
* Wechaty Getting Started: [Wechaty Getting Started](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started)
* Wechaty Documentation: [Wechaty Documents](https://wechaty.js.org)

## Concepts

* [Puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/wiki/Puppet): An abstract class containing bot conversation logic, part of Wechaty's technical architecture. By inheriting and implementing the Puppet abstract class (protocol) components, you can implement broader logic related to contacts, messages/one-to-one conversations, groups/chat rooms/many-to-many conversations, etc. Puppet in Chinese means puppet/marionette, which is quite fitting here.
* [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp): A node package based on gyp for compiling node native extension modules, and gyp is a tool used in the Chromium project for cross-platform compilation. See [installation documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
* [windows-build-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools): Node-packaged compilation tools for the Windows platform
* [node-expat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-expat): A node package based on libexpat for handling XML. libexpat is claimed to be the fastest XML parsing library, written in pure C language. Wechaty uses it to parse XML-based communications. See [installation documentation](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/): A timeless language; node-gyp depends on Python 2.7 for cross-platform compilation
* [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer): Programmable Google Chrome, officially produced by the Google Chrome team.
* [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/): puppeteer depends on a specific Chromium version. Chrome is open source Chromium + Google's closed-source extension package.

## Installation Steps

1. Download Wechaty source code

2. Install Wechaty dependencies and configure

3. Start Wechaty

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Download Wechaty Source Code

First we create a source code directory. This article uses ```D:\code```. If you use a different directory, make corresponding replacements in the following text. Let's start with the getting started project, run the following commands to download and enter the project directory:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/lijiarui/wechaty-getting-started.git
cd wechaty-getting-started
```

### 2. Install Wechaty Dependencies and Configure

First install node-v10.x.x. On Windows, using the official installation package is recommended. As of this writing, the [latest 64-bit system installation package](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.7.0/node-v10.7.0-x64.msi). If network speed is insufficient, using Thunder downloader is recommended.

Besides node-v10, Wechaty also depends on other software, and due to well-known network reasons, installing them won't be very smooth.

At this point, if you run npm install & npm start, you'll get the following error:

```bat
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.492]

npm: npm ERR!
npm:  code ELIFECYCLE

npm: npm ERR!

npm:  ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:

```

By reading the above log, the dependency relationship is analyzed as follows:

```bat
wechaty-puppet-puppeteer
    --> node-expat
        --> node-gyp
            --> gyp
                --> Python 2.7 & Windows Build Tools
```

Next, we need to install from the bottom of the dependency chain

**1. Install Python 2.7 to ``C:\Python27\python.exe``**, set environment variable ``PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe``

Note that node-gyp does not support Python 3.x. If you have Python 3.x installed, the error log looks like this:

```bat
Can't find Python executable "C:\Python36\python.EXE", you can set the PYTHON env variable.
```

You may wonder about this existing Python 3 path. Personally, I think this inaccurate error message can be considered a bug in the npm package.

### 2. Install windows-build-tools

Referring to the windows-build-tools official documentation, there are two methods:

* Visual C++ Build Tools
* Visual Studio 2017 vs Visual Studio 2015

Since I have already installed Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition, I didn't try other options. The key here is needing a VC++ compiler to compile Windows native programs. Visual C++ Build Tools is no longer available at Microsoft's official address and is not easy to find. npm officially recommends installing Visual Studio 2015. After installation, you can use ``npm install node-expat`` to verify if the above installation configuration was successful.

**3. [Install puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)**

Due to network reasons, the Chromium that puppeteer depends on cannot be installed smoothly. At this time, we can use a special cnpm tool provided by Alibaba to install:

```bat
npm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org
cnpm install puppeteer
```

PS: If you encounter "Chromium revision is not downloaded," setting PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD in solutions you find is actually misleading. This option won't help you install puppeteer, but rather lets you not download Chromium binary every time you update.

There's also a manual installation method, but not recommended: you can manually download the chromium installation package and place it in ``/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/``, for example:

```bat
D:\code\wechaty-getting-started\node_modules\_puppeteer@1.6.0@puppeteer\.local-chromium\win64-571375
```

This path on macOS is as follows, where the numbers may differ:

```bat
~/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/mac-526987/chrome-mac
```

### 4. .NET Framework 4.5.1 [Windows Vista / 7 only]

If using Windows Vista / 7, you need to manually install .Net Framework.

**5. If using Wechaty with PadChat component and have the corresponding token, you also need to set the following environment variables:**

```sh
WECHATY_LOG=silly
WECHATY_PUPPET=padchat
WECHATY_PUPPET_PADCHAT_TOKEN=*YOUR-TOKEN*
```

### 3. Start Wechaty

```sh
npm install & npm start
```

After running, the program will open a text QR code in the console window, with the QR code's URL below it.

If you encounter problems scanning the console text QR code, you can refer to my [blog post about QR codes](https://kaffa.im/a-story-about-text-qrcode.html).

## Summary

Since I successfully started the project, I haven't configured it on Windows 7 systems or 32-bit machines, but the main issues should be similar. For solutions, I recommend checking the documentation for the software where errors occurred.

Of course, if you encounter any other problems, feel free to contact me on [my Github](https://github.com/kaffa).
