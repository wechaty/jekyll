5G Chatbot (RCS) is China’s version of the GSMA RCS standard for rich messaging.

On March 30, the 6th Core Power Salon event themed “Developers, Assemble!” brought together more developers to open a new era of 5G messaging.

Speakers and guests included Li Dan (Secretary-General of the Value-Added Services Committee of the China Communications Enterprise Association; Deputy Leader of the 5G Messaging Working Group), Huan (Wechaty community founder), Zhang Ruining (Front-end Dev Lead, Fanlu Lab of CSU), Yang Yang (Senior Tech Manager, Hardcore Peach), and Mo Qian (Architect, Hardcore Peach).

Huan shared insights into Conversational AI, and presented a live demo of Wechaty’s zero-code-change compatibility running across multiple IM platforms. As 5G messaging rolls out, developers from WeChat/QQ ecosystems in the Wechaty community can also contribute to 5G Messaging chatbot development with Wechaty SDK.

We welcome everyone to pay attention to the operators’ expansion of chatbots in SMS for the 5G era. With the Wechaty SDK, you can build a 5G Chatbot in just a few lines of code and seamlessly integrate across WhatsApp / Wechaty / Gitter / QQ with zero code changes.

## Event Intro

From the Web era to mobile, and now to the age of AI and 5G, tech revolutions keep coming in just a couple of decades. Each revolution brings new opportunities and challenges. The choices of developers are where the times ultimately land.

As a new technology ecosystem, the promotion and adoption of 5G messaging requires the collective power of developers. The Hardcore Peach community invites experts and developers to share experiences and explore how to empower developers in this new field.
