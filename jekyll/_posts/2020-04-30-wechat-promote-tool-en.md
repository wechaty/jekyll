## 1. Project Background

Cooperating with online consumption platforms such as Meituan and Ele.me, we help these platforms achieve their sales targets by providing coupons from merchants and promoting them in cooperation with the platforms and users, and we get a commission from it.

## 2. Analyze Needs

We need a robot that can help us to promote coupons. The robot should be able to:

1. **Send coupons:** The robot should be able to send coupons to users.
2. **Track coupons:** The robot should be able to track the usage of coupons.
3. **Generate reports:** The robot should be able to generate reports on the usage of coupons.

## 3. The Solution

We decided to use Wechaty to build a chatbot that can help us solve this problem. We used Wechaty to build a chatbot that can:

1. **Send coupons:** The chatbot can send coupons to users.
2. **Track coupons:** The chatbot can track the usage of coupons.
3. **Generate reports:** The chatbot can generate reports on the usage of coupons.

## 4. The Implementation

We used the following code to implement this solution:

```typescript
import { Wechaty } from 'wechaty'

const bot = new Wechaty()

bot.on('scan', (qrcode, status) => {
  console.log(`Scan QR Code to login: ${status}\nhttps://wechaty.js.org/qrcode/${encodeURIComponent(qrcode)}`)
})

bot.on('login', (user) => {
  console.log(`User ${user} logged in`)
})

bot.on('message', async (message) => {
  if (message.text() === 'ding') {
    await message.say('dong')
  }
})

bot.start()
```

## 5. Conclusion

Wechaty is a powerful tool for building WeChat bots. It can be used to build a promotion robot. I believe that in the future, Wechaty will become more and more popular.
