<h2 id="wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-open-source-market---join-us">Wechaty Invited to GAIDC Open Source Market - Join Us</h2>

<p>With the explosion of ChatGPT, designed specifically for conversation, Wechaty has once again become a highly watched project in the open source community.</p>

<p>Over the past 3 months, dozens of projects based on Wechaty that integrate ChatGPT into chat software have been open-sourced on GitHub, with the most popular project already having 8K+ Stars.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/02-wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-en/image-1.webp" alt="image-1.webp" /></p>

<p>Through Wechaty, developers only need 6 lines of code to turn chat software into a Chatbot. Adding a few more lines of code can integrate AI models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, gaining rich conversational capabilities and making chat software an AI tool that aids creation and improves efficiency.</p>

<p>This weekend (25th-26th), Wechaty is invited to participate in the GAIDC Open Source Market, exchanging ideas with more AI projects and developers, sharing the “AI Carnival.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether you’re a newbie to AI wanting to learn more about all aspects of the industry</li>
  <li>Or an employed developer wanting to refine your skills or explore other career possibilities</li>
  <li>Or a technical expert wanting to discuss cutting-edge applications of large model technology from multiple perspectives of algorithms, computing power, and frameworks</li>
  <li>Or a research enthusiast wanting to know how artificial intelligence assists scientific research and discovery (AI for science)</li>
</ul>

<p>This developer pioneer conference held at Lingang Center is not to be missed!</p>

<p>The conference will feature cutting-edge forums on diverse topics such as AI programming, AI chips, AI+health, AI intelligent transportation, AI+robotics, metaverse, etc., opening the door to a new world for you.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/02-wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-en/image-2.webp" alt="image-2.webp" /></p>

<p>At the event, there will also be interactive experience areas, AI book exhibitions, and on-site recruitment sessions for AI companies in multiple hot fields - you can have your cake and eat it too. Of course, if you’re interested in the kaleidoscope of rich open source technology and open source culture, why not also visit the open source market!</p>

<h2 id="about-the-open-source-market">About the Open Source Market</h2>

<p>To allow developers and non-technical partners to appreciate colorful open source culture and project value, this conference has specially set up an open source market area, inviting 15~20 well-known domestic and international open source communities or related organizations to participate in construction, showcase open source charm, share community achievements, and attract more like-minded partners to join the open source family, level up together, and accompany each other on the growth path.</p>

<p>Time: February 25-26, 9:30-17:00</p>

<p>Location: Lingang Center, 555 Haigang Avenue, Pudong New District, Shanghai, 2nd Floor Shared Hall (West Passage 2)</p>

<p>It’s worth emphasizing repeatedly that the open source market is not only for technical developers but also welcomes operations, product, and marketing partners to exchange and learn together!</p>

<h2 id="navigating-the-open-source-market">Navigating the Open Source Market</h2>

<p>This market event has gathered open source projects from various cutting-edge technology directions, including open source frameworks for deep graph learning initiated by large companies, next-generation programming languages dedicated to liberating creativity by startups, and magical tools that can turn any chat software into a robot with just 6 lines of code!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/02-wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-en/image-3.webp" alt="image-3.webp" /></p>

<p>The entire market area is strip-shaped. When partners enter, they will receive a “Market Play Guide” (similar to a tour booklet), introducing the 20 booths’ corresponding projects and the gameplay instructions for the market area.</p>

<p>Each community will prepare 1~3 challenge tasks for partners (technical hands-on tasks for developers, non-coding questions for friends with non-technical backgrounds). Those who successfully complete the challenges can earn a certain amount of “Source Power” points and redeem corresponding community merchandise gifts.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/02-wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-en/image-4.webp" alt="image-4.webp" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/02-wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-en/image-5.webp" alt="image-5.webp" /></p>

<p>Moreover, each booth has 10 “Chosen Open Source Person” stickers every day (1 sticker = 3 “Source Power points”), rewarding partners who come to the booth for in-depth exchanges. At the exit of the market area, everyone can report their respective achievements and corresponding contact information; count again half an hour before the event ends, and those with the most accumulated points will receive blind box gift boxes full of value (worth 150~1000 yuan), stay tuned for prize information!</p>

<h2 id="special-segments">Special Segments</h2>

<p>To enrich everyone’s experience as much as possible and deepen understanding of real open source, this market area has two special segments:</p>

<h3 id="1-open-source-gathering-segment">1. Open Source Gathering Segment</h3>

<p>On the afternoon of the 25th from 13:30-17:00, there will be 2~3 organized gatherings (60~90 minutes each). Organizers have full freedom to play, which can be in diverse forms such as heart-to-heart talks, complaint sessions, roundtables, workshops, etc. Topics can also break away from pure technology itself and expand as much as possible. The conference official website can also synchronize information and sync with everyone as soon as possible!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/02-wechaty-invited-to-gaidc-en/image-6.webp" alt="image-6.webp" /></p>

<h3 id="2-open-source-open-mic">2. Open Source Open Mic</h3>

<p>On the afternoon of the 26th from 13:00-15:00 in the small stage area (1~2 minutes walk from the market area), project representatives will also be invited to the stage to share their projects’ founding intentions, development status, future visions, etc., with 5~6 minutes of lightning talk time for each, don’t miss it!</p>

<p>Guided jointly by the World Artificial Intelligence Conference Organizing Committee, Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization, Shanghai Talent Work Leading Group Office, and China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Lingang New Area Management Committee, and co-hosted by the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Industry Association and Shanghai Lingang Economic Development (Group) Co., Ltd., the 2023 Global Artificial Intelligence Developer Pioneer Conference (GAIDC) will be held in Shanghai on February 25-26, 2023.</p>

<p>GAIDC originated from the WAIC Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Developer Conference. After three years of development and precipitation, it has undergone comprehensive iteration and upgrade. This conference’s theme is “AI Developers Walking Towards the Light,” centered on AI developers, bringing the light of industry, technology, and the future to AI developers. The conference is held in Lingang, the place in Shanghai that welcomes the sunrise earliest. Through forums, gatherings, learning competitions, project roadshows, talent exchanges, book clubs, interactive experiences, and other sections, it focuses on professional cutting-edge content, joins forces with more than 20 domestic and international open source organizations and developer communities, invites global technical experts, mentor celebrities, and AI developers to participate offline together, while interacting and communicating online with tens of millions of professional developers, creating a free and lively atmosphere.</p>
