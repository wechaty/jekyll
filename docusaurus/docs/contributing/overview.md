## Guidelines for Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wechaty.

This post explains the process of contributing to the Wechaty project.

For all interactions within the project, kindly read and abide by the rules in [Wechaty Community Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

Wechaty is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we always need more people to help the users and the community. You can contribute in many ways, either to the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

### Why should you contribute?

As an open source organization with a useful and viable product, Wechaty thrives on the contributions of the community members. Regardless of your skill set, there are numerous things that you can do to help make Wechaty better, so start forking!

### Not sure where to start?

It is a myth that writing code is the only way to contribute to open source. The Wechaty community is very open to new ideas and there are so many different ways to make valuable contributions. We even have some ideas on how you can get started!

## Work on the Wechaty framework

The work on Wechaty itself falls into three (3) major areas:

### Writing code üíª

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Wechaty!

- Check out the GitHub issues with the tags `good first issue`, `pull request welcome`, or `help wanted`
- Write code examples for documentation
- Report a bug and work on resolving it
- Collaborate with others on building new features

Start from the [writing code docs](coding.md).

### Writing documentation ‚úçÔ∏è

Wechaty's documentation is one of its key strengths because it is informative
and thorough. As the framework evolves, you can help to improve the documentation and keep it
relevant from time to time.

- Fix typos in the documentation
- Translate documentation to your local language
- Write tutorials and blog posts, refer to <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts>
- Answer questions on the Wechaty Developers Home or GitHub issues
- Organize Wechaty meetups or user groups in your area

For more information, you may contact rui@Wechaty.io.

See [writing documentation](documentation.md) for more tips.

### Building RPA Puppet Provider/Service üó∫Ô∏è

Wechaty supports over ten (10) Puppet Providers & Services.
The RPA team is always looking for hackers
to help maintain and increase the IMs that the Wechaty ecosystem should support.

See [creating your puppet providers](../puppet-providers/diy.md)
to help expand the RPA for Wechaty.

**Tips:**
If you want to add new features or change the API, please submit an **issue** first to make sure no one else is already working on the same issue. Discuss the implementation and API details with the maintainers and users by creating an issue. When everything is settled down, you may submit a **pull request**.

Make sure to add **tests** for your features and bug fixes, and update the documentation (see below) before submitting your code!

### Contribute Support

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/wechaty/openapi/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

- Fix typos in the documentation
- Translate documentation to your local language
- Write tutorials and blog posts, refer to <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts>
- Answer questions on the Wechaty Developers Home or GitHub issues
- Organize Wechaty meetups or user groups in your area

For more information, you may contact rui@Wechaty.io.

If you think _working with Wechaty_ is fun, wait until you start working on it. Apparently, **ANYONE** can do something to help make Wechaty better and greater!

This contributing guide contains everything you need to know to help build the Wechaty chatbot framework. Browse the following sections to find out how:

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

**Fork using GitHub Desktop:**

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up the desktop.
- Once the desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

**Fork using the command line:**

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you are ready to merge them.

**Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):**

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

#### Open a pull request

When you are done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the **pull request template** to open your pull request (PR).

#### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you are going to want to do is a [self-review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions so always check your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue such as a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

#### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! The whole GitHub community is thankful for your help! :sparkles:

#### Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork before committing them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

## Join the Wechaty community ‚ù§Ô∏è

We are passionate about helping Wechaty users make the jump to become contributing members of the community. There are several other ways you can help the Wechaty community and others to maintain a great ecosystem to work in:

- Join the [Wechaty channel](https://gitter.im/wechaty/wechaty)
  on Gitter.im and answer questions.
  By explaining Wechaty to other users, you are going to learn a lot about the
  framework yourself.

- Join the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/discussions).
  This forum is a place for discussing the Wechaty framework, applications, and projects that use it. This is also a good place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or contributing to Wechaty.

- Join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/wechaty) and answer some questions.

- Blog about Wechaty. We syndicate all the Wechaty blogs we know about on
  the [community blogs](https://wechaty.js.org/blog);
  if you'd like to see your blog on that page, you can [register it here](blog.md).

- Contribute to open-source Wechaty projects, write some documentation, or release your code as an open-source pluggable application. The ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Wechaty, so help us build it!

**NOTE:** If you need any help, you can find related information in [Getting Help doc](getting-help.md)
.
We are looking forward to work with you. Welcome aboard! ‚õµÔ∏è

We have built Wechaty with pleasure because it can help others. Your help and contributions to Wechaty are very much appreciated by the community.

## Special Thanks

Wechaty would like to credit the Django doc authors because this documentation page is inspired by, and mostly copy-pasted from the [Django contributing docs](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/docs/internals/contributing/index.txt).
