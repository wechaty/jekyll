			<p>Global AI Bootcamp is a global AI developer training event initiated by Microsoft, aimed at bringing together developers worldwide to learn, exchange ideas, and jointly promote the rapid development of the artificial intelligence industry. On December 14, 2019, in a single day, tens of thousands of people from dozens of countries and 130 cities participated in this AI enthusiast celebration. At 6:30 PM that day, AI Bootcamp Beijing also opened as scheduled at the PNP startup incubator in Wudaokou, the center of the universe. Nearly 100 Chinese AI developers participated in the event, listening to eight industry experts share their insights.</p>
