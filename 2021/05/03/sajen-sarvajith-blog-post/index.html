  <li>Implementation/Approach</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
  <li>Additional Idea</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Users come to Wehcaty website seeking how to use wechaty to build a chatbot application for solving their problems. Unfortunately, the learning curve is not friendly to our users, they always struggle with setting up their development environment, can not get started with simplest example source code, and find it hard to know what they can do with the wechaty API. This problem leads to losing users for wechaty.</p>

<p>This project aims to improve the tutorials for wechaty in a way that the new wechaty users can run example source code in the browser and learn how to use wechaty in an interactive way.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>To make an interactive tutorial which allow users to learn by doing</li>
  <li>Get the user started</li>
  <li>Make sure the tutorial works all the time</li>
  <li>Ensure the users sees results immediately</li>
  <li>Make the tutorial repeatable</li>
  <li>This tutorial is going to focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts</li>
  <li>Provide the minimum necessary explanation</li>
  <li>Focus only on the steps needs to be taken</li>
  <li>Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the wechaty site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An interactive wechaty tutorial by using which the new users can understand easily by doing it live</li>
  <li>This easy and interactive tutorial helps the new users to get started in wechaty</li>
  <li>The tutorial will be tested several time and it will be stable once it is deployed</li>
  <li>When a user interacts by clicking run a code in the new tutorial the results will be shown up immediately without any delay</li>
  <li>This tutorial is easy to use, interactive and provides necessary explanation to the users to understand quickly and efficiently</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Implementation/Approach:</strong></p>

<p>Below explanation regarding the significant steps for this interactive and easy to use tutorial</p>

<h4 id="overview-section">Overview Section</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The beginner tutorial has different sections, the first section is overview and in that section new users can find an interactive way of description about the wechaty in general. This is achieved by using JS elements and the webpage intracts to user clicks and other actions rather than a static tutorial or a video tutorial, by this users will understand about the wechaty easily</li>
  <li>When a user reaches the end of the overview page there will be 2 options for the users, like the webpage will ask the new users that they have understood the above definition or not and the user must have to click it</li>
  <li>Once the user click anything from the options (understood or not) then 2 operations will take place the first one is the user answers will be saved in a "log" file which we can later use it as an review/survey taken for this tutorial by implementing this, the additional work to take a separate survey from the users about the tutorial is reduced and users can provide their reviews on the spot just by clicking which makes users an easy way to give feedback.</li>
  <li>The second operation is that when the user click they understood then it will move on to next section, When a user click don't understand the above overview of the wechaty given in the tutorial then by using JS the web page will refresh with an alternative text which will be more simplified version which explains about the wechaty, then there will be a GIF/videos running in the webpage which helps the user to visualise how the wechaty is working and implemented in different messaging platform like wechat, whatsapp etc. user can choose the messaging platform and they can visualise with a small GIF which demonstrate how the wechaty is working so because of this approach users can understand easily and there will also be an text which explains about the wechaty.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="quick-start-guide-section">Quick Start Guide Section</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This section is a quick start guide section where the new users can get in touch with the wechaty code live directly from the wechaty tutorial page.</li>
  <li>In this section there will be a step by step code with editor(terminal) available as well as a simple and clear explanation of what the code does in a beginner friendly way, users can change the code and explore with it by seeing the outputs of the code live from wechaty website without any delay.</li>
  <li>This method of tutorials is called learn by doing tutorials which can help beginners to get started with wechaty and understand wechaty easily and quickly. In this tutorial users can interact, understand and use wechaty from the website itself which will help the beginners to grasp how to implement wechaty in real world cases so easily</li>
  <li>The getting started code for beginners will be available in the new tutorial of wechaty website. The code will be in a sequence where the beginners can find the explanation for the code from how to install wechaty and start wechaty to make it run. All this can be done directly from the website of wechaty without any delay or hassles so that the new users can understand more easily than ever !</li>
  <li>The users can also edit the code right from the web page and the can run the code without any issues by doing this users can learn more about wechaty</li>
  <li>Then when a user understands the basics of wechaty and if the user needs to see the wechaty live in action then this can be done too! Directly from our website.</li>
  <li>Once the user finishes going through our interactive tutorial then when a user starts the wechaty with the command that is done in our local machine to start wechaty, this can be done in the website itself now the user can start and run the wechaty from our website without any delay or any issues. When a user start the wechaty and run wechaty in browser then a UI will pop in website where users can interact with the chatbot that they started in the wechaty website and also an output like in terminal will be shown.</li>
  <li>This UI is a demo to show the beginner users to see how the chatbot works in real time when implemented in any supported messaging platform so by this user can be able to understand and use wechaty without any hiccups.</li>
  <li>The main thing is that all these things are done client side without any delay or slow and users can see the results immediately as soon as they run the code in the interactive tutorial page. There is no backend required for this approach and this interactive page just works perfectly fine like fluid and the user cannot notice any lag in the outputs or in the performance of the wechaty and web page.</li>
  <li>All this is achieved through an JS emulation which works without any issues so by this wechaty and the interactive tutorial works flawlessly in the webpage like they run in real time. By using async functions, js workers and other frameworks an interactive experience is provided to the wechaty users.</li>
  <li>The user have also options to change the code and run wechaty simultaneously</li>
  <li>User can edit the code and rerun the cell for a different output this will work exactly like how terminal works but it works directly from our website with a modern look and extremely improved UI of the page so by this user can understand in a efficient way and the wechaty will also run accordingly with the new updates as user gives so they can interact and see how it works.</li>
  <li>All these beginner tutorials have the basic code to get started with wechaty as well as explanation which explains and makes users to understand the wechaty in an easy and interactive way.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:-</strong>  <strong>All the upcoming tutorials regarding overview, quick start, running locally, Money Bot, Assistant Bot, Coaxer Bot, using plugin, using redox and others will be made into an interactive way of learning tutorial in a step by step manner. These can be run directly in the website and users can edit the code and learn about the wechaty directly by doing it in our wechaty website. This approach that I have said above will help wechaty to run in the website itself. All these will be implemented as explained in the Quick Start Guide Section. I think this method will be more effective than a static website with a video tutorial because by this interactive learning tutorial users get the experience by doing it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This project will help the beginner/new users of wechaty to learn about wechaty in a interactive way and helps for better understanding without any hassles</li>
  <li>This interactive tutorial will helps users to run code directly from the wechaty website without any additional requirements needed</li>
  <li>These tutorials will have a step by step instruction as well as good and clear explanation</li>
  <li>There will also be an UI to see the wechaty live in action and the user can test the wechaty directly from the browser</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional Idea:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I am also interested in making this interactive beginner tutorial in different languages like chinese, english, Hindi, french etc.</li>
  <li>This makes our users learn about the wechaty in their preferred language so that beginner users will be more comfortable when going through this tutorial.</li>
  <li>Once I finish implementing this interactive tutorial then I will make a documentation for the code of this tutorial so that new developers can understand the code of this interactive tutorial and if they have any ideas to improve it they can improve it by going through the code documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="benefits-to-community">Benefits to community</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This project benefits the wechaty and open source community by improving the tutorials for wechaty in a way that the new/beginner wechaty users can run example source code in the browser and learn how to use wechaty in an interactive way.</li>
  <li>This interactive tutorial increases the pageviews and the duration of the tutorials will also be increased then the bounce rate of the tutorials will be decreased enormously.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The new tutorial will create a more personalized experience for the wechaty users</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This new tutorial establishes an interaction between users and the content. This interaction allows wechaty users to have a more personalized experience beyond just a static tutorial</li>
      <li>Not only does interactivity provide a better user experience, these interactions can also be measured. Using the data collected, we can see where/when/how users are clicking, and make adjustments to give them a more personalized experience. We can direct users to exactly what they are looking for and create more relevant tutorials for further visitors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This tutorial increases user engagement. This website tutorial allows users to interact and automate each visitor's experience.</li>
  <li>This website creates positive experience for our users</li>
  <li>
    <p>It increases conversions</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is done when we allow our visitors to do something and get a unique response back in regards to what was triggered.</li>
      <li>This tutorial attracts more visitors and to be more engaged with the website. As they become more engaged, their trust and interest grows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It invokes engagement and action. The thing that makes a website interactive is the ability for the user to actively engage with the content and various elements. This tutorial will break past one-way form of communication to start a two-way conversation with the user.</li>
  <li>This tutorial can be extremely beneficial to both users and the wechaty community by providing individual and robust platforms for beginner tutorials.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Submitting all the final works that is done from starting till now with good quality content and rich tutorials</li>
</ul>

<p>I have already explained this interactive tutorial in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szNLbHT8k6ty7xYE9aRvFW2QGrOeTKea5lfcUHLyPic/edit?usp=sharing">popsoal</a> I submitted. The interactive tutorial will have a step-by-step code block (code editor which and run code and provide output in wechaty website) with step-by-step instructions/explanation for each code so that users can run the code and learn from it even users can change the code directly from the website then re-run it. Finally the users can run the actually wechaty bots in the website itself then the bot can respond and interact with the user this is done to show the users how the wechaty bot will work if it's deployed in any messaging platform from this users will get a idea how the bot is working and users will learn to use wechaty easily than ever!. This is done through JS emulation that is explained in detail in the project proposal without any back-end needed for this approach and everything is done in the front-end.</p>

<p><strong>Second approach:</strong></p>

<p>Since we have development <a href="https://github.com/wechaty/PMC/issues/13">server</a> for wechaty community. By using this we can run all the code and this interactive tutorial can take advantage of this server. In this second approach the interactive tutorial will be done in the back-end and rendered in the front-end without any delay. The back-end scripts will be written in golang or rust so that it can be more fast to give users a real time experience.</p>

<p><strong>Final Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>So let's discuss both of the approaches and select which approach is good for making this interactive tutorial.</p>
