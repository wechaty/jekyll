<h2 id="project-proposal">Project proposal</h2>

<h3 id="project-title">Project title</h3>

<p>Create easy to learn tutorials for beginner users of Wechaty</p>

<h3 id="project-approach">Project approach</h3>

<p>This is a high level overview of how I intend to approach this project. This is an evolving plan which will likely change pending feedback from stakeholders.</p>

<h4 id="seek-to-understand-stakeholders">Seek to understand stakeholders</h4>

<p>The first thing I will do is try to understand my audience. The tutorials are meant for absolute beginners who want to learn Wechaty but  what else can we learn about them? If possible, I will seek answers to the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is their technical background?</li>
  <li>What demographic groups do they belong to?</li>
  <li>What problem are they trying to solve with Wechaty?</li>
  <li>What is their motivation for using/learning Wechaty? Is it for  profit? Are they hackers doing it for fun? Are they using  Wechaty for building school projects? Are they researchers/ academics? Is it a mix of the above categories of people?</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to  learn as much as possible about your audience before writing tutorials so that it is tailored to their needs.  Learning takes place much faster when it is structured from known to unknown and  reference  is made to what the learner already knows to explain a concept. It also ensures  cultural  sensitivity when giving examples especially in a global audience. The more you know about your audience the more relevant  your examples will be.
Develop content
Work with the project volunteer to come up with the list of key things a total beginner who wants to learn Wechaty needs to know. Break those key learning areas into the smallest units possible. For example a learner might need to set up a development environment. Setting up a development environment is not the smallest unit possible. It can still be broken down. For example one might need a  text editor,  install software such as  node or python,  have access to certain platforms e.t.c.</p>

<h4 id="sequence-content">Sequence content</h4>

<p>Sequence the learning areas which have been broken down in the previous step in chronological order. For example, the knowledge, skills and competences attained in step A might be prerequisite for step B, that of A and B might be needed for step C  and so on. If that is the case, it would make a lot more sense to sequence from A, to B then to C. Therefore sequencing the units appropriately from simple to complex, from known to unknown  will make the learning process enjoyable.</p>

<h4 id="formulate--instructional-objectives">Formulate  instructional objectives</h4>

<p>Turn those key learning areas into instructional objectives. The objective must be SMART.
 S  - specific
M - measurable
A - attainable
R - realistic
T - within a time bound
The smallest units in the previous sections can be amalgamated where necessary so as to make practical sense. A typical example of an instructional objective is: At the end of this section a learner should be able to set up a development environment for Wechaty. The objective is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and within a time bound i.e. from the start of the section till the end. Achieving the above objective should contribute in a certain way to the overall objective of learning Wechaty so that a combination of all the small learning objectives will translate into the overall objective.</p>

<h4 id="map--instructional-objectives-to-learning-activities">Map  instructional objectives to learning activities</h4>

<p>Identify practical, repeatable activities a learner can perform to achieve the stated objectives in the previous section. Let us say  the main learning activity is building a chatbot using Wechaty. We would need to answer the following questions.
What does building a chatbot using Wechaty entail?
What steps should a learner follow when building a chatbot using Wechaty?</p>

<p>This should be done while paying attention to the  objectives in the previous section  to make sure they are being achieved as the learner goes through these activities. The cardinal reason for going through the tutorials is to achieve the objectives in the previous section which will ultimately translate into the overall objective.</p>

<h4 id="structure-and-write-content">Structure and write content</h4>

<p>After outlining the activities in the previous section,  we  need to structure the content in a meaningful way. The proposed content structure and presentation  is to split the tutorial into high level units/ sections. Each unit/section will have the following components. This is important because it  ensures that anyone who has forgotten a specific concept can go to that specific section to remind themselves. Below are the proposed components of a unit. Each unit needs to have a  link to the next and previous  unit.</p>

<h5 id="section-heading">Section heading</h5>

<p>The section heading should be a high level summary of what the learner will be doing in a particular  section. It should capture the objective you wish to achieve by making the learner go through the activity.</p>

<h5 id="explanation">Explanation</h5>

<p>Immediately after the heading, there should be a brief explanation of what the learner will be doing in this particular  section and why they are doing it. The focus should be on the learner. It is therefore important to use  statements such as: In this section, you will declare a function which takes a string as argument and returns the number of characters in it. The focus here is on what the learner will do.</p>

<h5 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h5>

<p>After an explanation of what the learner will do  in this section as articulated in the preceding subsection, there should be an outline of what the learner should know or have,  to be able to complete this section successfully. For example the knowledge acquired in the preceding sections might be necessary to be able to complete this section. A learner might also need to have access to certain platforms such as whatsapp or facebook. This is where the prerequisites have to be clearly outlined. Prerequisites could also be software or other tools necessary to complete the section.</p>

<h5 id="steps">Steps</h5>

<p>These are the actual steps a learner will have to go through. If it is a multi-step process, you can  number them. For example step 1, step 2, step 3  and so on. There is no need to number if it is a single step process.</p>

<h5 id="expected-output">Expected output</h5>

<p>What should happen if a learner successfully followed the steps outlined in the above subsection. An example of expected output is: After successfully installing software  X, you should see it listed in the package.json file. We can also provide hints on possible  challenges  the learner might encounter in this section and how they can be fixed.</p>

<h5 id="fun-quiz">Fun Quiz</h5>

<p>If  possible,  simple optional quizzes should be included at the end of each section to test the knowledge gained. This can boost the morale of the learner and give feedback about the progress they are making.</p>

<h5 id="additional-resources">Additional resources</h5>

<p>This is an optional  section which points to additional resources a curious learner can explore to expand their knowledge about what has been covered in that particular section. It can link to Wechaty API if necessary.</p>

<h5 id="things-to-pay-attention-to-while-writing-the-tutorial">Things to pay attention to while writing the tutorial**</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Use simple English that a non native speaker can easily understand without having to look up meaning of words or phrases</li>
  <li>Avoid long sentences.</li>
  <li>Minimize use of acronyms</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessarily long paragraphs which might confuse learners</li>
  <li>Use formal language</li>
  <li>Be gender sensitive. Gender neutral language  is better</li>
  <li>Pay attention to grammar and spelling</li>
  <li>Pay attention to technical accuracy</li>
  <li>Focus more on what the learner will do</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="proposed-timeline">Proposed timeline</h4>

<p>Below is an estimate of the timeframe  within which  this project will be completed. It has been broken down  into subtasks. It is worth pointing out that the processes below are not linear. They are iterative and cyclical. They can  change as feedback is received from  different stakeholders and incorporated in the project.</p>
