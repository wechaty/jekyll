<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>I’m ashamed to say that it has been two weeks since the party when I wrote the blog. During this time, my work has been trivial and I haven’t had time to organize it. Now I will make it up.</p>

<p>On August 4th, I left the office in Foshan and took the subway to Wuyangcun, Guangzhou. I was about to attend a Guangzhou team event initiated by Teacher Jiarui a week ago.</p>

<p>Teacher Jiarui happened to come to Guangzhou for a meeting during this time, so we had this opportunity to meet.</p>

<p>I saw that it was a rare opportunity. Although my workplace is not in Guangzhou, it is not troublesome to go there. Moreover, I can get to know the great gods who are showing their talents in open source projects, so I plan to attend and listen to them to broaden my horizons.</p>

<p>As a result, I signed up with the mentality of just being an observer. To my surprise, this turned out to be a three-person gathering of me, Teacher Jiarui, and Wechaty’s number zero contributor, senior @0.</p>

<p>Because Teacher Jiarui was going to have a meeting at Tencent’s Guangzhou Research Institute in the afternoon, the meeting was scheduled near Zhujiang New Town. We had lunch around 11:30. By the way, only senior @0 is a native of Guangzhou and is more familiar with the terrain, so he arranged the location.</p>

<p>I was 15 minutes later than the scheduled time. After getting off the Wuyangcun subway station, I walked for about five minutes to reach “Shifangyuan Vegetarian”. Senior @0 and Teacher Jiarui had been there for a while.</p>

<p>This place is a terrace on the third floor, but it is enclosed with glass to make a small private room with air conditioning. The view is very good, you can see the pedestrians on the street and the exquisite green plants, which is very pleasant.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2020/08-wechaty-guangzhou-gathering-en/pic1.webp" alt="Party picture" /></p>

<p>After I arrived, Teacher Jiarui enthusiastically introduced senior @0 to me, especially mentioning that senior @0’s Wechaty bot has not been offline for three years. Then Teacher Jiarui also took out the small gifts carefully prepared for us - the new book “Chatbot from 0 to 1 - A Practical Guide to Conversational Interaction Design” by Teacher Jiarui, Teacher Zhuohuan and Teacher Li Yunjun, and also wrote a message and signature, as well as some Wechaty peripheral stickers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2020/08-wechaty-guangzhou-gathering-en/pic3.webp" alt="Party picture" /></p>

<p>Then we took a group photo and started this exchange. For me, this meeting was more from the perspective of a learner and an observer. In this meeting, I learned about the history of the wechaty project and the entrepreneurial experience of the bigwigs, which gave me a lot of inspiration.</p>

<p>Recently, when talking about senior @0’s bot that has been stable for many years without going offline, he said that a large part of the reason is that the main purpose of this bot is to monitor information, and it does not perform any sending actions. Therefore, although it has been using the web version of WeChat login with puppeteer, it can still survive in the complex and ever-changing WeChat ecosystem. Against the background of the recent WeTool incident, various policy adjustments of the web version of WeChat, and other account blocking environments, how to standardize our own or customers’ use of robots to operate under a reasonable and legal ecological rule is the way to sustainable development.</p>

<p>Teacher Jiarui also shared that in the very early days of the Wechaty project, Teacher Zhuohuan was the main force of project development, and then senior @0 joined the project and made a lot of contributions. Senior @0 also mentioned Teacher Zhuohuan many times, saying that he often saw Teacher Zhuohuan active in various GitHub open source projects late at night, and expressed his deep appreciation for Teacher Zhuohuan’s continuous and vigorous contributions to open source projects and coding for many years.</p>

<p>Later, we also talked about the entrepreneurial experiences of senior @0 and Teacher Jiarui. Senior @0 is an entrepreneur in the era of China’s Internet pioneering. He once managed a technical team of thousands of people and made many attempts in many intelligent applications. However, these experimental projects may have been too far ahead of the development of the times and did not wait for the best market opportunity. And Teacher Jiarui is also a second-time entrepreneur. Juzi Interactive is her second entrepreneurial project. Then Teacher Jiarui also answered some of my questions and introduced some of Juzi Interactive’s business and model.</p>

<p>Finally, we also talked about the operation of the Apache Foundation and open source projects. Like my own feeling, the team led by Teacher Zhuohuan does have extremely rich experience and strong strength in the construction of open source projects. The contributions made to promoting the development of the domestic open source ecosystem are indeed very precious.</p>

<p>As for myself, in the short time since I joined the python-wechaty group, I have indeed felt the charm of open source projects and mastered the workflow of some open source projects. In terms of skills, I have also learned a lot from the excellent practices of some open source projects, such as the CI of GitHub Actions, the extensive use of Makefile, etc. I hope I can go further and further with the development of this platform!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2020/08-wechaty-guangzhou-gathering-en/pic5.webp" alt="Party picture" /></p>

<p>Finally, after I came back, I carefully read Teacher Jiarui’s book. It is indeed a rare theoretical and practical guide in the field of dialogue robots. Here I will promote Teacher Jiarui’s book. I hope everyone will support it! I also hope that there will be more opportunities to participate in offline activities of open source projects in the future, and Wechaty will get better and better!</p>
