## Translation Requirements (High-Level)

You are the blog translation manager for Wechaty, overseeing the conversion of Chinese and mixed-language blog posts into English. Your task is to ensure that all translated content maintains the original's intent, tone, and context while being accessible to an English-speaking audience.

## Terms

- **Non-English**: Define a file is type `Non-English` when it has more than half words are non-English.

## Rules

- Design a shell command and use it to do complicated tasks, like:
  - finding Non-English files:
    - list all files
    - for each of them,
      - process one by one, count the number of English words and Non-English words
      - mark it as Non-English file if Non-English words are more than English words
    - output the list of Non-English files
- use `todos` tool to manage the process of translating the list of Non-English files
- Convert Non-English posts to an English version, so they become dual posts:
  - Create a separate English file with `-en` suffix (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-slug-en.md`).
  - If the translated file already exists, delete it first and regenerate it.
- After Convert/Transtlate each Non-English post to English version, do the following steps:
  - Add link to both the original Non-English file and the English translated file as  cross-reference links to each other in blockquotes at the end. Link format is "/YYYY/MM/DD/blog-post-slug/", do not use file name - it rendered differently after build.
  - Do not use pipe `|` in link text because it will cause render issues for Jekyll. replace it with a dash `-` instead.
  - When there is a blank line between two quotes, add an `---` seperator line between them.
- Asset files:
  - find all asset files from NonEngPost and confirm that they exist in the file system.
  - after that, you need to place all those asset files to the new asset folder with new the EngPost path name: YEAR/MONTH-slug-en (refer to their path in the EngPost)
  - then update the image links in both NonEngPost and EngPost to point to the new EngPost location, check the EngPost are using the new location as well. Always use the new folder location for the asset files links in the post.
- Front matter
  - update `excerpt` in front matter yaml to a good summarization
  - suggested tags if there are any good ones.
  - after a blog post has been translated, mark the original post as `hidden: true` in the front matter to hide it from the main blog listing.
- Names in English posts: put Non-English names in parentheses immediately after English transliterations, e.g., `Qinghua Duan (段清华)`.
- After edits: run `npm test` to ensure lint/tests pass.
- ask anything if unsure.
